# Restaurant Stage 3 Project

Stage 3 objective is to add additional functionality to the application built in stage one and two.
A form will be added to allow users to create their own reviews. If the app is offline, the form will defer updating to the remote database until a connection is established. Finally, the site will be further optimized to meet even stricter performance benchmarks using Lighthouse.
